      <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
      <p>
        I developed a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        It showcases my education, skills, and projects in a clean and user-friendly design.
        The goal of this project was to create a professional online presence and practice front-end web development.

      <h3>Student Management System</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a Java and MySQL-based application designed to manage student details efficiently.
        It allows adding, updating, searching, and deleting records while maintaining data consistency.
        The system was built to strengthen my knowledge of database connectivity and Java programming.
